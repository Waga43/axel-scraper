# aria2-scraper
scrapes and downloads over multiple connections using aria2 and wget

Usage:
sudo apt install aria2 git

git clone https://github.com/pinilpypinilpy/aria2-scraper/

cd aria2-scraper

bash scrape+download.sh http://your.url.here/your/target/directory/here/

output files are stored in the downloaded directory

note: I made this is 20sec and it will probably not work as intended. For instance I keep getting aria2 errors, but everything *should* work in the end
